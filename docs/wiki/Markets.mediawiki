In the real world shops or markets have several beneficial roles: they facilitate offer/demand encounter, they secure the producer/consumer exchange, they guarantee the quality of the items, they generate VAT for the good functioning of states. The protocols will allow for virtual counterparts of these markets, accomplishing just the same purposes. 

SXP will include an ad hoc virtual market creation protocol, whereby founding members:
* Establish a market signature 
* Register and publish the availability of items, as well as demands for items
* Allow for possible deals including a possible guarantee policy and the required VAT
* Witness the resulting muli-party exchanges with the market signature.
