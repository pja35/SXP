We call on:

-   Security protocol experts, peer-to-peer protocol experts, to help us
    design the protocols
-   Programmers in general
-   Economists to help us refine the
    [discussions](/wiki/Category%3ADiscussion_Pages "wikilink"), which may
    help us to take some design decisions
-   Infographists, publicists to help put these ideas forward in a clear
    manner, perhaps in small cartoon/video
-   All good wills, to do whatever they understood might be useful
