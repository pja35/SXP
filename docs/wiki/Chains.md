exchanges between many parties at the same time, and facilitating
further exchanges of newly acquired items. This way contracts do not
have to be between or depend upon just two participants, they can
involve several transactions that are interdependent, such as a chain.

SXP will seek to compensate for this downside in many ways:

-   allowing all sorts of moneys;
-   contracts are by default non-nominative and bear clear delivery and
    validity informations, so that they may be exchanged further;
-   exchanges can be made between an arbitrary large number of parties;
