The link does not grant access to the whole document, however I recovered it.
This is a recent review paper by specialists, hence a good entry to the topic.
The comments here are biased towards SXP. 

== Fair Exchange ==

Describes fair exchange protocols as ways to exchange things between distrustful parties in such a way that either both parties receive what they expect or neither parties does. Includes receipts for payments, certified mail, and contract signatures more specfically.

== Types of Fair Exchanges (FX) ==

=== With a Trusted Third Party (TTP) ===

Requires a referee. In the setting of SXP, maybe the market could maybe play such a role, but this is costly.

The protocols that implement this have a simple common pattern. 
Alice (A) and Bob (B) need to sign contract (C) with there private keys PrivKA/PrivKB, Trent (T) is the Trusted Third Party. 
See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_protocol_notation here] for the notation.

:<math>A\rightarrow B:\{\{C\}_{PrivKA}\}_{K}</math>
:<math>A\rightarrow T:K</math>
:<math>B\rightarrow T:\{\{C\}_{PrivKA}\}_{K},\{C\}_{PrivKB}
:<math>T\rightarrow B:K</math>
:<math>T\rightarrow A:\{C\}_{PrivKB}</math>

To be honest I am not sure why going through K is necessary, this looks like an optimization for Digital Certified Mail. In the explanations all this seems to boil down to the boring protocol:

:<math>A\rightarrow T:\{C\}_{PrivKA}</math>
:<math>B\rightarrow T:\{C\}_{PrivKB}</math>
:<math>T\rightarrow A:\{C\}_{PrivKB}</math>
:<math>T\rightarrow B:\{C\}_{PrivKA}</math>

=== Being Optimistic ===

Does not require a referee, unless there is a conflict.

==== Optimistic FX ====
==== Verifiable escrow of digital signatures ====
==== Verifiable escrow using pre-issued coupons ====

=== Exchanging in parts ===

== Questions on this paper ==


Why not go for the following natural solutions: the contract C wears the mention "This contract is not valid if not signed by PubKA, and then by PubKB by time t". This way Alice can safely sign it with PrivB and send it to Bob. Bob may not sign it but then the contract is not valid. To validate he must sign it and have it time-stamped by time t... OK maybe there would be two problems:
* Alice is not ensured to get her copy of the valid contract;
* The time-stamping service would need to be solicited all too frequently.
