The question of whether there are ways of raising taxes on virtual
markets is somewhat far-away from current technical status of the SXP
project. Yet, it may be a question that one wants to consider before
entering the project. Here are some rough ideas.

-   The state could ask for VAT to be raised as part of every SXP
    contract, and consider this as a necessary condition for the SXP
    contract to be valid before the law. Parties would then be naturally
    inclined to raise VAT, so that their contracts be enforced.
-   The state could pay its contractors and civil servants in
    "Tax credits". Any tax credit that is emitted by the state to some
    persons, will eventually be claimed back by the state from some
    other persons, in payment of their taxes. Therefore, tax credits
    have a clear value: that of freeing certain persons of their
    due taxes. Hence contractors and civil servants will have no trouble
    using their tax credits as some sort of currency. See
